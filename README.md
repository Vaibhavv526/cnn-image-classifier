# CNN Image Classifier 🧠📊

A simple **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based web app built with **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit** to classify handwritten digit images (0–9).

This project is beginner-friendly and perfect for anyone who wants to **understand deep learning practically**, not just theory.

---

## 🔍 What this project does

* Upload a handwritten digit image (PNG/JPG)
* The CNN model predicts the digit (0–9)
* Clean and interactive Streamlit UI

---

## 🚀 Who should check this out?

* Students interested in **Deep Learning / AI**
* Beginners learning **CNNs**
* Anyone who wants a **hands-on TensorFlow project**
* People exploring **Streamlit deployment**

## 🌐 Live Demo

Deployed using **Streamlit Cloud** 🎉

(Upload a handwritten digit image and see the prediction in real time)

---

## 📌 Notes

* The model works best with **clear handwritten digits**
* Image is resized and preprocessed before prediction
